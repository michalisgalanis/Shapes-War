# Shapes war, a cross-platform 2D arcade shooter game.

Shapes war is a unique fast-paced 2D arcade shooter where you must survive enemy waves for as long as possible. As you progress, you can unlock and upgrade new items like weapons and powerups but you also encounter new, more powerful enemies and bosses. It features minimalist graphics with a vivid color palette, fluid animations, and rich soundtracks. It uses Unity as the game engine and itâ€™s been written in C#.

## Note: Development has been moved over to Unity Collab since September 2019.
